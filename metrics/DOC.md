## <a name="pkg-overview">Overview</a>
`http_metrics` provides client and server side reporting of HTTP stats.

The middleware (server-side) or tripperware (client-side) must be given a reporter to record the stats for each request.

Prometheus-based reporter implementations for client and server metrics are included. The user may choose what level of
detail is included using options to these reporters.

## <a name="Middleware">func</a> [Middleware](./middleware.go#L17)
``` go
func Middleware(reporter Reporter) httpwares.Middleware
```
Middleware returns a http.Handler middleware that exports request metrics.
If the tags middleware is used, this should be placed after tags to pick up metadata.
This middleware assumes HTTP/1.x-style requests/response behaviour. It will not work with servers that use
hijacking, pushing, or other similar features.

#### Example:

```go
r := chi.NewRouter()
r.Use(http_ctxtags.Middleware("default"))
r.Use(http_metrics.Middleware(http_prometheus.ServerMetrics(http_prometheus.WithLatency())))
r.Get("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    w.WriteHeader(200)
})
http.ListenAndServe(":8888", r)
```

## <a name="Tripperware">func</a> [Tripperware](./tripperware.go#L15)
``` go
func Tripperware(reporter Reporter) httpwares.Tripperware
```
Tripperware returns a new client-side ware that exports request metrics.
If the tags tripperware is used, this should be placed after tags to pick up metadata.

#### Example:

<details>
<summary>Click to expand code.</summary>

```go
c := httpwares.WrapClient(
    http.DefaultClient,
    http_ctxtags.Tripperware(),
    http_metrics.Tripperware(http_prometheus.ClientMetrics(http_prometheus.WithName("testclient"))),
)
c.Get("example.org/foo")
```

## <a name="Reporter">type</a> [Reporter](./reporter.go#L12-L15)
``` go
type Reporter interface {
    // Start tracking a new request.
    Track(req *http.Request) Tracker
}
```
Called when a new request is to be tracked.

## <a name="Tracker">type</a> [Tracker](./reporter.go#L18-L35)
``` go
type Tracker interface {
    // The exchange has started. This is called immediately after Reporter.Track.
    // On the client, this is called before any data is sent.
    // On the server, this is called after headers have been parsed.
    RequestStarted()
    // The request body has been read to EOF or closed, whichever comes first.
    // On the client, this is called when the transport completes sending the request.
    // On the server, this is called when the handler completes reading the request, and may be omitted.
    RequestRead(duration time.Duration, size int)
    // The handling of the response has started.
    // On the client, this is called after the response headers have been parsed.
    // On the server, this is called before any data is written.
    ResponseStarted(duration time.Duration, status int, header http.Header)
    // The response has completed.
    // On the client, this is called when the body is read to EOF or closed, whichever comes first, and may be omitted.
    // On the server, this is called when the handler returns and has therefore completed writing the response.
    ResponseDone(duration time.Duration, status int, size int)
}
```
Receives events about a tracked request.
